# FlaskBB-Monolith-to-microservice
This repository contains the source code and implementation of an automated framework for extracting microservices from monolithic software systems. Using FlaskBB as a primary case study, this tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture structural dependencies.
